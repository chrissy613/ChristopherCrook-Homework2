# ChristopherCrook-Homework2
I created the three seperate html files for each of the website's sections. 
I decided to use 3 seperate CSS sheets, one for each section, so that I could be flexibile with how I style the different pages. 
I used a previous assignment as a template and removed/editted many elements to personalize the site. 
I utilized grid elements such as columns and rows to arrange the images, text, and forms. 
I used bootstrap to find a template for the contact forms and customized it. 
Because the assignment asked for minimal use of media queries, I used css width properties to properly display the content of my pages on all devices.
I added my picture and a pic I found on the web to personalize the website, along with adding a small biography before I filled out the page with lipsum. 
I checked the site out on my phone and it looked exactly as I wanted it to.
