# ChristopherCrook-Homework2
I created the three seperate html files for each of the website's sections. 
I decided to use 3 seperate CSS sheets, one for each section, so that I could be flexibile with how I style the different pages. 
I used a previous assignment as a template and removed/editted many elements to personalize the site. 
I utilized grid elements such as columns on my portfolio tab to arrange the images and text. 
I used bootstrap to find a template for the contact tab and customized it.
